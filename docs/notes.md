when this website is cleaned up then can move it to Rmap repo?
- yep, just move it to the rmap directory...
- can go through and remove styles/themes that aren't used/needed
- get the favicon to work

- sort rest of website, clean it up a little and move it to the Rmap directory.
    - move it to rmap directory
    - sort the favicon (this should be editing the head file)
    - put some words in the about section, etc.

- need to add some place for the data to go for the question mark directives

# Domain name
- see what comes of the poll on the group

# layout
- sort footer (need to do soemthiung to get it to align)
- link to delve in the about section, put some stuff in there

# possible changes to map.js 
- some of the incoming data seems to be nan (no confidence intervals showing on the rt projection)
- charts should scale y axes to the data in them

# Issues
- can't get favicon to work

JUST NEED TO MOVE TO RMAP REPO NOW
