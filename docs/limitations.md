There are a number of limitations to our current approach, 
which are important to take into account.
*   Testing capacity and regimes in the UK has changed over time. This is particularly salient in the difference between Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 tests, and in the widening application of Pillar 2 tests, initially in healthcare workers, then to key workers, and now to the wider community.
*   Particularly, delays between infections and test results are unknown, different across Pillars 1 and 2, and across time.
*   NHS Test and Trace and outbreak investigations mean that testing is now more targeted, and, from the perspective of understanding rates of transmissions from case counts, can introduce biases.
*   Uncertainties in Rt in local authorities are high and sensitive to random local events.
