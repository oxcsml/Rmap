There are a number of limitations to our current approach, 
which are important to take into account.
*   Testing capacity and regimes in the UK has changed over time. This is particularly salient in the difference between Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 tests, and in the widening application of Pillar 2 tests, initially in healthcare workers, then to key workers, and now to the wider community.
*   Particularly, delays between infections and test results are unknown, different across Pillars 1 and 2, and across time.
*   NHS Test and Trace and outbreak investigations mean that testing is now more targeted, and, from the perspective of understanding rates of transmissions from case counts, can introduce biases.
*   Uncertainties in $R_t$ in local authorities are high and sensitive to random local events.
*   There can be substantial selection bias in the population who get tested, leading to differences between the number of cases in an area and the true size of the epidemic there. 
*   Like [Cori et al (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwt133), our model assumes that $R_t$ is constant in each weekly period within a given local authority in order to reduce posterior uncertainty.
