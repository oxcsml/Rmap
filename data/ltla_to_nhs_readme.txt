This maps Lower Tier Local Authorities (NUTS-3) regions to UK NHS regions.

Note that is not a 1:1 correspondence with NUTS-1 and NHS regions. In particular:
- Cumbria is split between different NHS regions.
- The Bassetlaw LTLA (NUTS-3) is grouped with North East and Yorkshire in an NHS region, although the rest of its NUTS-2 ULTA region is grouped with the Midlands.

The NHS regions labels in the CSV are based on the map in https://www.gettingitrightfirsttime.co.uk/hubs/.

Knowing the LTLA to NHS regions mapping is useful as two other systems that predict Rt,
- epiforecasts.io/covid/posts/national/united-kingdom/
- www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/nowcasting-and-forecasting-21st-october-2020/
both predict on NHS regional level.

(The subnational data in epiforecasts.io/covid/posts/national/united-kingdom/ is on 'NHS regions' according to github.com/epiforecasts/covidregionaldata/tree/v0.7.0)
